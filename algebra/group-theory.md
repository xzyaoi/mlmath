# Group Theory

## Definitions and Properties

**Definition 2.1.1 \(Definition of Group\)** Let $$G$$ be a set and " $$\star$$ " an operation, i.e. an application defined from $$G \times D$$ onto G:

$$
\forall (x,y) \in G \times G, x \star y \in G
$$

that has the following properties:

1. $$\forall x,y,z \in G, (x \star y) \star z = x \star (y \star z)$$:$$\star$$ is associative.
2. $$\exists e \in G, \forall x \in G, x \star e = e \star x = x$$: e is a neutral element.
3. $$\forall x \in G, \exists y \in G, x \star y = y \star x = e$$: y is an inverse of $$x$$.

is called a group.

**Definition 2.1.2 \(Definition of Abelian/Commutative Group\)** 

If $$G$$ is a group, and $$\forall x, y \in G, x \star y = y \star x$$**,** then the group $$G$$ is said to be commutative or Abelian. _The name Abelian group is a salute to a Norwegian mathematician named_ [_Niels Henrik Abel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel)_._

**Theorems 2.1.3 \(Properties of Group\)**

1. The neutral element is unique.
2. Inverse of ****$$x$$ is unique.
3. Let $$a,b \in G$$, there exists a unique $$x \in G$$ such that $$a \star x = b$$, this is $$x = a^{-1} \star b$$.
